I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection (1-2 paragraphs): This is the main html page. I feel with any html page the 
    most challenging part was nesting everything correctly. Having an understanding of 
    flexbox helped me a lot. Before I was only comforatable with css grid which will 
    get the job done but I have come to appreciate flexbox more. Before, I never used flexbox
    but now I have found myself using it more and more. (I may like it more than css grid). Reguardless
    they both are extremely powerful and both have their certain use cases. 
    
    This was also my first time experimenting with iframes, specifically with youtube and maps. They add
    a whole new level of interactivity to a website which is always a plus. However, I believe they have to 
    be used sparingly as to not overwhelm the user and to keep the website yours. You typically do not want 
    it to be all links to other websites or sources. I also appreciated using google fonts and fontawesome. Once
    again extremely powerful tools that enhance the look of any website. -->

                    <p>Mountain biking is a great form of exercise 
                        that can improve your cardiovascular health, 
                        build strength, and increase your endurance. 
                        Biking itself is also a great excercise as it is low-impact,
                        this makes it ideal for those who may have joint issues or other limitations.
